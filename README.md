# Anything is a Service



## Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where **DevOps meets humor**, and **automation** is the name of the game!  
When I'm not wrangling clouds, building pipelines, or pushing code, you can probably find me sipping coffee and automating _literally_ everything.

## A bit about me...

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** – Speaking cloud fluently since... well, forever. If it scales, I'm on it.  
- **Microsoft Azure** – Cloud computing with a touch of blue! Because who doesn't love a multi-cloud strategy?  
- **Ansible Automation** – Manual configs? Nah, life's too short for that. Automate all the things!  
- **Apache / NGINX** – The fearless gatekeepers of the web. If it's traffic, they control it.  
- **CI/CD** – Always moving forward, one pipeline at a time. Push, pull, deploy, repeat.  
- **ContainerD / Docker / Podman** – I like my containers how I like my coffee: light, fast, and scalable.  
- **ELK** – Logs? Check. Metrics? Check. Dashboard? You bet!  
- **Git** – Code is life. Push, pull, merge, conquer.  
- **HashiCorp & Terraform** – Infrastructure as code... or as I like to call it, "Lego for grown-ups."  
- **Kubernetes / Rancher / Red Hat OpenShift** – Because managing a single cluster is just too boring.  
- **SSL / KeyCloak / LDAP** – Because security isn’t like adding sprinkles on a cake after it’s baked.  
  You can’t call it an MVP if it’s just "Mostly Vulnerable Product"! No technical debt allowed here.  
- **YAML** – Writing human-readable code one indent at a time. Clean and crisp.  
- **VMware / Unix / Linux Admin** – Managing servers like a pro, making sure everything is running smoothly.  
- **TCP/IP** – The real magic behind the internet. I keep the network gods happy.  
- **Zabbix** – Monitoring like a pro, because if you can’t measure it, it didn’t happen.
