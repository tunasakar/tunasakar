# Hi there! 👋 I'm Tuna Sakar 🐟

Welcome to my GitHub profile, where **DevOps meets humor**, and **automation** is the name of the game! When I'm not wrangling clouds, building pipelines, or pushing code, you can probably find me sipping coffee and automating _literally_ everything. ☕🤖

## A bit about me...

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** 🌩 – Speaking cloud fluently since... well, forever. If it scales, I'm on it.
- **Microsoft Azure** ☁ – Cloud computing with a touch of blue! Because who doesn't love a multi-cloud strategy?
- **Ansible Automation** 🔧 – Manual configs? Nah, life's too short for that. Automate all the things!
- **Apache / NGINX** 🏰 – The fearless gatekeepers of the web. If it's traffic, they control it.
- **CI/CD** ⏩ – Always moving forward, one pipeline at a time. Push, pull, deploy, repeat.
- **ContainerD / Docker / Podman** 🐋 – I like my containers how I like my coffee: light, fast, and scalable.
- **ELK** 🦌 – Logs? Check. Metrics? Check. Dashboard? You bet!
- **Git** 💾 – Code is life. Push, pull, merge, conquer.
- **HashiCorp & Terraform** 🌍 – Infrastructure as code... or as I like to call it, "Lego for grown-ups."
- **Kubernetes / Rancher / Red Hat OpenShift** 🧱 – Because managing a single cluster is just too boring.
- **SSL / KeyCloak / LDAP** 🔐 – Because security isn’t like adding sprinkles on a cake after it’s baked. You can’t call it an MVP if it’s just "Mostly Vulnerable Product"! No technical debt allowed here.
- **YAML** 📜 – Writing human-readable code one indent at a time. Clean and crisp.
- **VMware / Unix / Linux Admin** 💻 – Managing servers like a pro, making sure everything is running smoothly.
- **TCP/IP** 📡 – The real magic behind the internet. I keep the network gods happy.
- **Zabbix** 📊 – Monitoring like a pro, because if you can’t measure it, it didn’t happen.
