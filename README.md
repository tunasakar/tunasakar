# About Me

Iâ€™m **Tuna** â€” a **DevOps & Platform Engineer** and **IIoT Enthusiast** â€” on a lifelong mission to automate anything that moves (and most things that donâ€™t).

When Iâ€™m not deep in the CI/CD matrix or smoothing out Kubernetes tantrums, youâ€™ll probably find me sipping Ã§ay and whispering sweet nothings to my `.bashrc`, while refactoring 10-year-old shell scripts buried somewhere in `/etc/`.

- **AWS** â€“ Speaking cloud fluently since forever. If it scales, I'm on it.
